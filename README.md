# JMcDo29 NestJS-Playground

A nothing special repository for me to play around with a lot of Nest configurations and probably break some stuff while doing so. Currently using a plain database driver, custom configuration module, and MongoDB for showing things off!

## Implemented

* DatabaseService (pg driver)
* Configuration (Validation using Joi)
* MongoDB (Nest package)

## Features to Come

* **Tests!**
* WebSockets
* Microservices?
* Authentication?

## Requests

[Submit an issue](https://github.com/jmcdo29/NestJS-Playground/issues/new) if you want to see something done and I'll see if I can't get to it eventually! Make sure there isn't [already as solution for it](./tree/master/Issues%20%26%20Solutions) first.
